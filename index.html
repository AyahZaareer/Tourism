        Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting,
        accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.[2] The World Tourism Organization
        defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to
        holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not
        more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".[3] Tourism
        can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both
        incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.

        Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second
        half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,[4][5] but
        slowly recovered until the COVID-19 pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth. The United Nations World Tourism
        Organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might decrease by 58% to 78% in 2020, Sleading
        to a potential loss of US$0.9â€“1.2 trillion in international tourism receipts.[6]
